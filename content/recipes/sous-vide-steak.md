## Instructions

1. Start by selecting your steaks and placing them into a vacuum-seal bag along with the whole garlic cloves, rosemary, and sage.
2. Vacuum-seal the bag to remove all air and ensure a tight seal.
3. Prepare your Sous Vide water bath by setting the temperature to 54°C for medium-rare.
4. Once the water bath reaches the desired temperature, submerge the sealed bag with the steaks into the water. Make sure the bag is fully submerged.
5. Cook the steaks in the water bath for 2 - 2.5 hours.
6. Remove the bags from the water bath and take the steaks out of the bags. Pat them dry with paper towels.
7. Heat a skillet over high heat and add the olive oil.
8. Season the steaks with salt and pepper. 
9. Flip the steaks every 15-20s until both sides develop a brown crust. Baste the steaks in the flavoured oil as you cook sear them. 
10. Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.

## Notes
Searing the steak really doesn't take as much time as you think. Pay attention.
