A perfectly roasted chicken with crispy golden skin and juicy meat. This classic Sunday roast is simple to prepare and makes an impressive centerpiece for a family meal.

## Ingredients

- 1.8kg whole chicken
- 1 lemon, halved
- 1 whole head of garlic, halved horizontally
- 4-5 sprigs fresh thyme
- 4-5 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 50g butter, softened
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 500g baby potatoes
- 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
- 2 onions, quartered

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F).

2. Remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature. Pat the skin dry with paper towels.

3. Stuff the cavity with lemon halves, garlic, and half the herbs.

4. Mix the softened butter with salt, pepper, and finely chopped leaves from the remaining herbs. Rub this mixture all over the chicken, including under the skin of the breasts if possible.

5. Drizzle with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.

6. Place the chicken in a roasting tin. Arrange potatoes, carrots, and onions around it. Season the vegetables and drizzle with a little olive oil.

7. Roast for 20 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 190°C (375°F) and continue roasting for about 1 hour 10 minutes, or until the juices run clear when you pierce the thickest part of the thigh.

8. Baste the chicken with the pan juices halfway through cooking, and turn the vegetables for even browning.

9. Remove from oven and let the chicken rest for 15 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the meat moist.

10. Serve with the roasted vegetables and make a simple gravy from the pan juices if desired.

## Notes

To check if the chicken is cooked, insert a skewer into the thickest part of the thigh. The juices should run clear with no trace of pink. Alternatively, use a meat thermometer - it should read 75°C (165°F) in the thickest part of the thigh.

Save the carcass to make homemade chicken stock. Simply simmer it with onions, carrots, celery, and herbs for 2-3 hours.

For extra crispy skin, you can increase the oven temperature to 220°C for the last 10 minutes of cooking.
