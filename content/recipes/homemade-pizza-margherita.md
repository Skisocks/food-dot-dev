Nothing beats a homemade pizza with a perfectly crispy crust, simple tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil. This recipe requires some planning for the dough rise, but the results are worth it.

## Ingredients

### For the Dough:
- 500g strong white bread flour
- 325ml warm water
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- 7g instant dried yeast
- 2 tbsp olive oil

### For the Topping:
- 400g can of good quality Italian tomatoes
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 300g fresh mozzarella, torn into pieces
- Fresh basil leaves
- Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling

## Instructions

1. Make the dough: Mix flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, mix warm water with yeast and let sit for 5 minutes until foamy.

2. Pour the yeast mixture and olive oil into the flour. Mix until it comes together, then knead on a floured surface for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.

3. Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel, and leave in a warm place for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.

4. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Crush the tomatoes by hand. Heat olive oil in a pan, add garlic, and cook for 1 minute. Add tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for 15-20 minutes until thickened.

5. Preheat your oven to its highest setting (usually 240-250°C/475-480°F). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.

6. Divide the dough into 4 portions. On a floured surface, stretch or roll each portion into a thin circle about 25cm diameter.

7. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on each base, leaving a 1cm border. Add torn mozzarella pieces.

8. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the crust is golden and crispy, and the cheese is bubbling.

9. Remove from oven, add fresh basil leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, and serve immediately.

## Notes

For the best crust, let the dough rise slowly in the refrigerator overnight instead of the quick 1-2 hour rise.

If you don't have a pizza stone, use an inverted baking sheet preheated in the oven.

Don't overload the pizza with toppings or sauce. Less is more for achieving that crispy crust.
