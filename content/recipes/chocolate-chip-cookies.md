These chocolate chip cookies are crispy on the edges, chewy in the middle, and loaded with chocolate chips. The secret is using brown butter and letting the dough rest before baking.

## Ingredients

- 225g unsalted butter
- 200g light brown sugar
- 100g granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 300g all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 300g chocolate chips (mix of dark and milk chocolate)
- Flaky sea salt for topping (optional)

## Instructions

1. Brown the butter: In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and continue cooking, swirling occasionally, until it turns golden brown and smells nutty, about 5-7 minutes. Pour into a bowl and let cool for 10 minutes.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together the browned butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until combined. Add eggs and vanilla, whisking until smooth.

3. In another bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.

4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.

5. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes, or up to 24 hours for best results.

6. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

7. Scoop dough into balls (about 2 tablespoons each) and place them 5cm apart on the baking sheets.

8. Bake for 11-13 minutes, until the edges are golden but the centers still look slightly underdone.

9. Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle with a pinch of flaky sea salt if desired.

10. Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Notes

The dough can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Bake straight from frozen, adding 1-2 extra minutes to the baking time.

Don't overbake! The cookies will continue to cook on the hot baking sheet after you remove them from the oven. They should look slightly underdone in the center when you take them out.

For extra indulgence, use a mix of chocolate types: dark, milk, and even some white chocolate chips.
