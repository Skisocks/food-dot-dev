A timeless Italian classic that comes together in minutes with just a few simple ingredients. The key is to use the pasta water to create a creamy, silky sauce without cream.

## Ingredients

- 400g spaghetti
- 200g pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large eggs
- 100g Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated
- 50g Parmesan cheese, finely grated
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente.

2. While pasta cooks, fry the pancetta in a large pan over medium heat until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. No need to add oil as the pancetta will render its own fat.

3. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, Parmesan, and a generous amount of black pepper.

4. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining. Drain the spaghetti.

5. Remove the pan with pancetta from heat and add the hot drained pasta. Toss to coat in the fat.

6. Add the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta, tossing quickly and continuously. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time until you achieve a creamy, silky sauce that coats the pasta.

7. Serve immediately with extra Pecorino Romano and black pepper on top.

## Notes

The key to perfect carbonara is temperature control. The pan should be off the heat when you add the egg mixture to prevent scrambling. The residual heat from the pasta and the hot pasta water will cook the eggs gently, creating a creamy sauce.

Traditional carbonara doesn't use cream, garlic, or onions. The creaminess comes from the egg and cheese emulsion with pasta water.
