Aromatic, creamy, and packed with flavor, this Thai green curry is better than takeout. Adjust the spice level to your preference and serve with jasmine rice.

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 3-4 tbsp Thai green curry paste
- 400ml coconut milk
- 200ml chicken stock
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp palm sugar or brown sugar
- 500g chicken breast, sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 100g green beans, trimmed and halved
- 1 small aubergine (eggplant), cubed
- 4 kaffir lime leaves
- 1 handful Thai basil leaves
- Juice of 1 lime
- Jasmine rice, to serve

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the curry paste and fry for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

2. Pour in the thick part of the coconut milk (the cream that rises to the top) and stir to combine with the paste. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the oil starts to separate.

3. Add the chicken pieces and stir to coat in the curry paste. Cook for 3-4 minutes.

4. Add the remaining coconut milk, chicken stock, fish sauce, and sugar. Stir well and bring to a simmer.

5. Add the aubergine and cook for 5 minutes, then add the bell pepper and green beans. Tear in the kaffir lime leaves.

6. Simmer for another 10 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is cooked through.

7. Taste and adjust seasoning with more fish sauce if needed. Remove from heat and stir in Thai basil and lime juice.

8. Serve immediately with steamed jasmine rice.

## Notes

Thai green curry paste can vary in spiciness, so start with less and add more to taste.

For a vegetarian version, substitute chicken with tofu and use vegetable stock and soy sauce instead of fish sauce.

Kaffir lime leaves add authentic flavor but can be substituted with lime zest in a pinch.

The curry tastes even better the next day as the flavors develop, so it's great for meal prep.
